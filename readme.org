#+title: Captive portal dispatcher script

Motivation:

I don't use any DE that would handle captive portals for me, hence i need
something like that script.

None of at the time listed on arch-wiki solutions to 'auto-opening' captive
portal on public networks worked for me. Either didn't work because was written
for X, was simply trying to open some http page or required some additional
setup like using chrome or other additional packages. All i needed was to just
figure out the captive portal url and open its page in default browser. That all
this script does.

This script assumes you are under Wayland session and using systemd.

If that script will be useful to someone and aur package will be needed - create
an issue.
